# Intain Campus FinTech Challenge 2026 | Full Stack Track

## Loan Data Verification Copilot

*Build an AI-assisted full-stack console that turns messy loan records into validated, traceable, trusted data.*

---

## 1. Challenge Summary

Financial platforms depend on loan-level data. But loan data rarely arrives clean. It may come from CSV exports, APIs, servicing systems, origination systems, or manually maintained spreadsheets.

The challenge is to build a **Loan Data Verification Copilot**: a full-stack application that ingests messy loan records, detects data-quality issues, uses AI assistance to explain and resolve exceptions, and creates a traceable verified record.

*This is not a structured-finance challenge. Participants do not need to understand securitization, asset-backed securities, waterfall models, borrowing bases, or capital markets.*

## 2. Overview

Can you build a system that takes a messy loan tape and turns it into a clean, verified, auditable dataset?

- Data ingestion and normalization
- Backend validation and exception handling
- Full-stack workflows and role-based interfaces
- Audit logs, record hashing, and traceability
- AI-assisted review and agentic coding discipline
- API design, deployment, and demo readiness

---

## 3. Business-Adjacent Context

A loan tape is simply a table of loan records. Each row represents one loan; each column describes attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, origination date, maturity date, borrower state, payment status, document availability, and last updated date.

Platforms that work with loans need to trust this data before using it for analytics, reporting, review, or operational workflows. The challenge is to build the verification layer that makes this possible.

## 4. Public Data Source URLs

The organizer should provide a curated synthetic dataset for default judging. Participants may optionally use the public sources below for stretch features, public-data connectors, or alternative ingestion pipelines, subject to the relevant source terms.

| Source | Actual URL | What participants can get | Access / usage note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Data** | [https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/credit-risk-transfer/single-family-credit-risk-transfer/fannie-mae-single-family-loan-performance-data](https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/credit-risk-transfer/single-family-credit-risk-transfer/fannie-mae-single-family-loan-performance-data) | Acquisition data, performance data, sample file, glossary/file layout, Data Dynamics access, and APIs. | Registration and terms acceptance required. Best used as schema inspiration and optional data source. |
| **Fannie Mae Data Dynamics access page** | [https://datadynamics.fanniemae.com/data-dynamics/#/reportMenu;category=Loan_Performance](https://datadynamics.fanniemae.com/data-dynamics/#/reportMenu;category=Loan_Performance) | Direct portal for Single-Family Loan Performance Data downloads. | Registration required. Use only if participants want to work with actual Fannie Mae data. |
| **Fannie Mae sample file / file layout** | Start from the main Fannie Mae page above and use links titled "Sample File" and "CRT Glossary and File Layout." | Sample acquisition/performance file and schema definitions. | Useful for designing the simplified synthetic schema. |
| **Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset** | [https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset)<br>[https://claritydownload.fmapps.freddiemac.com/](https://claritydownload.fmapps.freddiemac.com/) | Loan-level mortgage performance data, standard dataset by year, non-standard dataset, sample files, user guide, file layout, and release sample files.<br>Direct access portal for Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset downloads. | Registration/sign-in through Clarity Data Intelligence required. Free for non-commercial, academic/research, and limited use subject to terms.<br>Registration/sign-in required. Use for teams that want to download Freddie Mac data directly. |
| **Freddie Mac file layout and sample files** | Start from the Freddie Mac dataset page and use the links under "Upcoming Disclosure Changes" and "Additional Resources." | General user guide, file layout, file headers, sample files, FAQs, release notes. | Useful for schema reference and sample-file design. |

> **Recommendation:** Use a synthetic organizer-provided dataset for judging. Use public datasets as references and optional stretch sources because official datasets may be large, registration-gated, and subject to source-specific terms.

## 5. Organizer-Provided Data Package

The default competition package should be synthetic, but modeled on public loan-level schemas. It should not require participants to register with public data portals or interpret complex data dictionaries during the hackathon.

- `loan_tape.csv` - primary dataset with 1,000 to 5,000 loan records.
- `servicer_update.csv` - second-source update file with partial or conflicting loan information.
- `document_manifest.csv` - mock document availability by loan ID.
- `validation_rules.json` - configurable rules for validating records.
- `users.json` - mock users and roles.
- `expected_exception_sample.csv` - small sample of known exceptions for orientation.

---

## 6. Example Dataset Fields

- `loan_id`
- `borrower_id`
- `loan_type`
- `origination_date`
- `maturity_date`
- `original_principal`
- `current_balance`
- `interest_rate`
- `term_months`
- `borrower_state`
- `loan_purpose`
- `credit_grade`
- `employment_length`
- `income_band`
- `payment_status`
- `days_past_due`
- `servicer_name`
- `last_payment_date`
- `last_updated_at`
- `document_status`
- `source_system`

---

## 7. Intentional Data Issues

- Missing loan IDs
- Duplicate loan IDs
- Duplicate borrower + loan amount + origination date combinations
- Invalid date formats
- Maturity date before origination date
- Negative principal balance
- Current balance greater than original principal
- Interest rate outside expected range
- Payment status inconsistent with days past due
- Missing document status
- Conflicting values between `loan_tape.csv` and `servicer_update.csv`
- Stale records based on `last_updated_at`
- Invalid state codes
- Suspiciously repeated borrower records
- Loans marked closed but still showing positive balance
